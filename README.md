# Saily eSIM: Stay Connected Worldwide, Built-in Security Features, Affordable Data Plans

So you're scrolling through your phone at the airport, desperately trying to figure out where to buy a local SIM card, and you're already annoyed because the queue is long, the sellers look sketchy, and you just want to message your friend that you've landed safely. Sound familiar?

Here's the thing about travel in 2026 - we've moved past the SIM card hunt. The folks behind NordVPN (yeah, the security company you probably already know) built something called Saily, and it's basically killed the "buying SIM cards at sketchy airport kiosks" tradition. Let me walk you through why this matters.

## What Actually Is Saily (Without the Marketing Nonsense)

Saily is an eSIM app. That means it's a digital SIM card that lives inside your phone - no plastic card to fiddle with, no tiny metal chip to lose under your airplane seat. You download their app, pick a data plan for wherever you're going, and boom, you've got internet when you land.

The real kicker? It's from Nord Security, the same team that makes NordVPN. So they brought their security expertise to travel data, which means you're getting more than just internet access.

**Coverage:** Over 200 destinations worldwide  
**Network Speed:** 4G/5G (depending on local infrastructure)  
**Plan Types:** Local, regional, and global options  
**Starting Price:** From $1.89 for 1GB

Here's what makes it interesting - they've built security features right into the app. While other eSIM providers just sell you data, Saily throws in an ad blocker, web protection, and virtual location routing. It's like they looked at what travelers actually worry about (sketchy Wi-Fi, data usage, privacy) and just... fixed it.

## The Plans: Pay for What You Need (Not What They Want to Sell You)

Let me break down what Saily actually costs, because eSIM pricing can be confusing as hell.

### Popular Destination Pricing (2026)

| Destination | Data Amount | Validity | Price | Price per GB |  |
|-------------|-------------|----------|-------|--------------|-----|
| **United States** | 1GB | 7 days | $3.99 | $3.99/GB | [Get Plan](https://saily.com) |
| **United States** | 3GB | 15 days | $8.99 | $3.00/GB | [Get Plan](https://saily.com) |
| **United States** | 10GB | 30 days | $21.84 | $2.18/GB | [Get Plan](https://saily.com) |
| **Europe (35 countries)** | 1GB | 7 days | $3.99 | $3.99/GB | [Get Plan](https://saily.com) |
| **Europe** | 3GB | 15 days | $8.99 | $3.00/GB | [Get Plan](https://saily.com) |
| **Europe** | 10GB | 30 days | $18.04 | $1.80/GB | [Get Plan](https://saily.com) |
| **Thailand** | 1GB | 7 days | $3.99 | $3.99/GB | [Get Plan](https://saily.com) |
| **Thailand** | 5GB | 15 days | $11.39 | $2.28/GB | [Get Plan](https://saily.com) |
| **Japan** | 1GB | 7 days | $3.99 | $3.99/GB | [Get Plan](https://saily.com) |
| **Japan** | 10GB | 30 days | $21.84 | $2.18/GB | [Get Plan](https://saily.com) |
| **Global (121 countries)** | 1GB | 7 days | $5.99 | $5.99/GB | [Get Plan](https://saily.com) |
| **Global** | 10GB | 180 days | $57.00 | $5.70/GB | [Get Plan](https://saily.com) |

**Unlimited Data Plans** are available in 37 destinations including USA, France, Italy, Spain, Thailand, and Turkey. These range from 10-30 day validity periods.

The pattern here is obvious - buy more data, pay less per gigabyte. Pretty standard stuff, except Saily's pricing actually beats most competitors when you compare apples to apples. For example, a 1GB plan in the USA costs $3.99 with Saily, while Airalo charges more for the same thing.

## Saily Ultra: The "Forget About It" Plan

Now, if you travel frequently (like, multiple countries per year), Saily's Ultra plan might make sense. It's $59.99/month, and here's what you get:

**Unlimited global data** in 121 countries (30GB high-speed, then unlimited at 1Mbps)  
**Full Nord Security suite:** NordVPN, NordPass, NordLocker, and Incogni  
**8% cashback** in Saily credits on additional purchases  
**Priority support:** Jump the queue when you need help  
**Airport perks (coming soon):** Lounge access and fast-track security

Let's do the math - NordVPN alone costs about $12/month if you buy it separately. Add the unlimited global data, password manager, encrypted storage, and data removal service? The Ultra plan starts looking less like "expensive eSIM" and more like "bundled travel toolkit."

It's marketed at digital nomads and frequent business travelers, and honestly, that makes sense. If you're bouncing between countries monthly, paying $60 once beats buying separate data plans every time you land somewhere new.

## The Security Features Nobody Else Bothers With

This is where Saily gets interesting, because most eSIM providers just connect you to a network and call it a day. Saily actually thought about what could go wrong.

**Ad Blocker:** Blocks annoying ads, but here's the real benefit - it saves you up to 28.6% of your data. Ads eat data to load, so blocking them means your 5GB plan suddenly acts more like 7GB. Smart.

**Web Protection:** Automatically blocks malicious websites and limits tracking. You know those sketchy links you almost click when you're tired at 2am in a hotel? This catches them.

**Virtual Location:** Routes your traffic through servers in 100+ countries. Useful for accessing content that's geo-blocked, or just adding privacy when you're on public networks.

**Data Routing Through Netherlands:** All traffic goes through 1Global's hub in the Netherlands by default. It's like a lightweight VPN that's always on.

The security stuff isn't just marketing fluff - it's actually built by the NordVPN team, so they know what they're doing. Most travelers don't think about security until their credit card gets cloned after using airport Wi-Fi, so having this baked in is pretty nice.

## Real Users, Real Experiences

I dug through Trustpilot (18,000+ reviews, 4.7/5 stars) and Reddit threads to see what actual travelers say. Here's the pattern:

**What people love:**
- Setup is ridiculously easy - even non-tech people get it working in minutes
- Internet connects the moment you land (sometimes before the plane even reaches the gate)
- Customer support responds fast, usually within 1-2 minutes on chat
- Built-in security features feel premium

**What people complain about:**
- Coverage gaps in some countries (like Cuba, Laos)
- Some users in Sri Lanka reported intermittent connections
- Prices shown in USD which confuses some international users
- Data-only (no phone calls or SMS, you'll need WhatsApp/FaceTime)

The negative reviews are mostly about coverage in specific remote locations or user expectations around having a phone number. If you're going to major cities and tourist destinations, the reviews are overwhelmingly positive.

One traveler mentioned using it across UK, Netherlands, and Belgium - said the internet was faster than their friends using roaming plans. Another tested it in Hong Kong and Thailand with zero issues. The consensus seems to be: major destinations work great, super remote areas are hit or miss.

## How to Actually Use This Thing

Setting up Saily is straightforward, even if you've never used an eSIM before:

1. **Download the app** from App Store or Google Play
2. **Create an account** (Google, Apple, or email)
3. **Pick your destination** and data plan
4. **Apply a promo code** if you've got one (search for "MVT5" for 5% off, or "CNEWS5" - multiple codes floating around)
5. **Install the eSIM** following the app's instructions
6. **Activate when you're ready** (auto-activates when you land or after 30 days)

The whole process takes maybe 5 minutes. You can set it up from your couch before you even leave for the airport, which beats standing in line at a kiosk while your taxi meter runs.

Your existing SIM stays active for calls and texts, while Saily handles your data. On newer phones (iPhone 13+, recent flagship Androids), you can run multiple eSIMs simultaneously, which is even cleaner.

## Current Promo Codes & Deals (January 2026)

Right now, several promo codes are floating around:

- **MVT5** - 5% off (from travel bloggers)
- **CNEWS5** - 5% off on plans with 10GB+
- **Student discount** - Up to 15% off with Student Beans verification
- **Referral program** - Both you and friends get $5 off

The codes stack differently depending on what you're buying, so test a few at checkout to see which gives the best discount.

## Saily vs. The Competition

How does Saily stack up against other eSIM providers?

**vs. Airalo:** Saily is generally cheaper and includes security features. Airalo has more plan variety including some with calls/texts.

**vs. Holafly:** Holafly specializes in unlimited plans but costs more. Saily's unlimited plans are typically $5-10 cheaper and include security features Holafly doesn't have.

**vs. Local SIM cards:** Local SIMs might be cheaper for data (like $10 for 90GB in Spain), but you deal with registration hassles, marketing spam, and the time/effort to find them. Saily costs more per GB but saves the headache.

The value proposition isn't just about price - it's about convenience + security + reasonable pricing. If you want absolute cheapest data and don't mind jumping through hoops, local SIMs win. If you value time and security, Saily makes more sense.

## Who Should Actually Use Saily

This makes sense for:

- **Frequent travelers** who visit multiple countries throughout the year
- **Digital nomads** who need reliable internet for work
- **Business travelers** who can't afford connectivity issues
- **Privacy-conscious people** who want built-in security
- **Anyone who hates dealing with physical SIM cards**

This probably doesn't make sense for:

- **People visiting one country for months** (local SIM might be cheaper)
- **Travelers who need phone calls/SMS** (it's data-only)
- **Those visiting Cuba or super remote areas** (coverage gaps)
- **Extreme budget travelers** (local SIMs are cheaper per GB)

## The Bottom Line

Saily isn't revolutionary - it's just an eSIM that works well and doesn't try to screw you over. The pricing is transparent, the security features are genuinely useful (not marketing fluff), and the setup is easy enough that your parents could probably figure it out.

Is it the absolute cheapest? No. Is it the most convenient way to stay connected while traveling without worrying about security or hunting for SIM cards? Yeah, probably.

The real question is whether you value convenience and security enough to pay a bit more per gigabyte. If you do, Saily's a solid choice. If you're fine spending an hour at the airport finding a local SIM and don't care about built-in VPN features, save your money.

For most travelers though? Just download the app, pick a plan, and stop thinking about internet access. That's kind of the point.
